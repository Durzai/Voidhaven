	description "The Colossus was designed to answer the need for safe transport of vast amounts of cargo over long distances without an escort fleet. The Colossus has enough durability and weaponry to endue a prolonged battle with a hostile fleet and arrive at it's destination intact."
	description "It is easy to mistake the Colossus for it's smaller cousin at a distance, and only veteran freighter captains or wealthy companies can afford to deploy these gargantuan vessels; but their reliability and competence is unmatched and necessary on the fringes of republic space."
