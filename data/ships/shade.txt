	description "The Shade is a purpose built support warship, it's powerful long-range tactical surveillance and interference suites make it a valuable asset to any fleet; and while it's armament capabilities are light for a ship of it's tonnage, it more than makes up for it in it's defensive capabilities and vast sensor utility."
