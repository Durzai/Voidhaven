	description "The Voidhaven Shipyards Warhawk was designed as a jack-of-all-trades, master of none; but often times better than a master of one. It does not excel in any single category when compared to other heavy warships, but has become popular as a generalist vessel with a great deal of modularity and flexibility."

	description "The Voidhaven Shipyards Star Titan was born of humanity's venerable star liners, unfortunate ships captured by pirates; left derelict by battle or bad luck. Voidhaven has breathed new life into this dying breed of starships, hybridizing the vast number of scrapped star liner hulls and selling a true titan of modern star liner industry, outclassed only by the jealously guarded city-ships of The Deep."
	description "The Star Titan engineers have been praised for their innovative restructuring of the forward engine nacelles, hollowing a majority of the space out for two drone bays; and keeping just enough internal space for a set of small maneuvering thrusters to aid in the smooth turning of the elongated hull.
